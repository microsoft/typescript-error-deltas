# typescript-error-deltas

Download and compile popular open source repos in order to compare new versions of the Typescript compiler with the current version.
For example, this project will clone the prettier repo and compile it with the current version of Typescript.
Then it will compile it with a version of Typescript from a pull request.
Afterward it will compile new errors that are issued only with the new version and post them as a comment on the pull request.
