# typescript-error-deltas

Download and compile popular open source repos in order to compare new versions of the Typescript compiler with the current version.
For example, this project will clone the prettier repo and compile it with the current version of Typescript.
Then it will compile it with a version of Typescript from a pull request.
Afterward it will compile new errors that are issued only with the new version and post them as a comment on the pull request.

### User Tests

There are three kinds of user tests, all of which aim to use popular packages with different versions of Typescript:

1. Example projects, which specify a popular package in package.json and then provide an example use of it.
2. Clones of a repo of a popular package, built with `tsc`.
3. Clones of a repo of a popular package, built with a custom `bash` script.

#### Example projects

Use `userTests/axios` as an example:

- Create a package.json with `axios` as a dependency.
- Create an example program that uses `axios`. In our case, just:
  - index.ts
  - tsconfig.json

#### Clone repos (simple build)

Use `userTests/axios-src` as an example:

Create `test.json` like the following:

``` json
{
    "cloneUrl": "https://github.com/axios/axios.git",
    "types": ["node"]
}
```

The `types` field is optional; it installs `@types/` packages for each entry in its array before running `tsc`.
This is mostly useful if the package isn't written in Typescript and doesn't include types in its own devDependencies.

#### Clone repos (script build)

Use `userTests/azure-sdk` as an example; create a script `build.sh` that:

- Clones a repo.
- Installs its dependencies.
- Alters its Typescript dependecy to use a custom Typescript version.
- Builds the repo.

The details vary considerably from project to project.
